 <span><p>If you can make boxed macaroni and cheese, 
    you can make this one-pan, scratch-made mac and cheese! 
    <br> The bacon, chives, and crispy bread crumb topping add some great extra flavor and texture.

    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. <br> Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, <br>until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
    </ol>
